# MiniMozo

App Description:
This a basic Android Project which is a miniature version of Monty Hall problem. I have tried to convert it into a game
where user will be given 3 Windows initially. Among 3 windows, one window will have jackpot and rest 2 will be having nothing.
User has to pick one window, after picking App will display it one window which has nothing. With 2 windows left, user will be
given an option to swap his original choice with the window which is left. Once the decision has been made from user, app will
show the result.
